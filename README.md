# Meme maker: ***MEME++***

## Description:

Nothing against 'registration and login pages', 'message lists' or 'responsive forms', constantly replicated for the purpose of practicing some programming language or technology. However, in order to break this uniformity, I decided to challenge myself in the formulation of a different project... And that's how the meme manager - 'MEME++' was born.
Although apparently simple, this project allowed me to step out of my comfort zone and practice the skill of consuming an external API [Imgflip API](https://imgflip.com/api) using JavaScript fetch to fetch the list of repositories, in addition to styled Components and React HOOKS, to handle the effects and state changes generated by the request.
The application is hosted on the Netlify platform (https://www.netlify.com/). You can access Meme++ through the link (https://memeplusplus.netlify.app/) to create your own memes and share with your friends.
ENJOY!

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
